# web-deployment

The main page with new links is: https://eclectic-matt.github.io/Github-Pages-Home/

These files relate to the eclectic website (formerly eclecticapp.xyz but I no longer own this domain)
This is now half-deployed on Github pages at: https://eclectic-matt.github.io/web-deployment/

Some files are backups of pages and some are helper files for specific functionality.
This deployment is being developed and expanded over time.

Feel free to get in touch with any ideas.
