# web-deployment

The main page with new links is: https://eclectic-matt.github.io/

Some of these files relate to the eclectic website (formerly eclecticapp.xyz but I no longer own this domain)
The homepage is available on Github pages at: https://eclectic-matt.github.io/web-deployment/

Some files are backups of pages and some are helper files for specific functionality.
This deployment is being developed and expanded over time.

There are a few extra tools being deployed here which are one-off projects/testing and personal interest pages.

Feel free to get in touch with any ideas.
