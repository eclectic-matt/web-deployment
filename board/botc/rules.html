			<h2>The Basics</h2>
			<p>Blood on the Clocktower is a deduction/detective game with a social layer and hidden-roles.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>One team is <b>good players... who don't know who each other are</b></p>
			<br>
			<p>They will be going up against a team of <b>evil players led by the DEMON - and the baddies usually DO know who each other are!</b>.</p>
			<br><br>
			<p>During the day, players will discuss the information they have and try to establish who is lying and potentially an evil player.</p>
			<p>Every player has a special ability linked to their ROLE - some helpful, others.... less than helpful!</p>
			<br>
			<p>Each day, players will have the opportunity to NOMINATE and then EXECUTE one player, hoping to kill the Demon and win the game.</p>
			<p>Then at night, the Demon will usually get to kill a player, aiming to kill off all the good players.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>Teams</h3>
			<p>The good team is formed of Townsfolk (who have helpful abilities) and Outsiders (who have unhelpful abilities).</p>
			<p>The evil team is formed of the Demon (who usually kills each night) and Minions (who help the Demon stay hidden).</p>
			<br>
			<p>Bear in mind that some good players have reasons to lie (see Empath, Undertaker, Monk, Mayor).</p>
			<p>At the same time, bear in mind that the evil team will also be lying to cover up their true role!</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>Nominating and Executing</h3>
			<p>Each day, nominations will open and any player who is alive can publicly nominate a player (including themselves).</p>
			<p>The player does not need to be alive to be nominated or executed, but there isn't often benefit to this.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The player who nominated will be given the chance to make the "case for the prosecution" - why the believe they should execute</p>
			<p>The player who is nominated will then get the chance to make the "case for the defense" - why they should stay alive!</p>
			<br>
			<p>If more than half the living player count (rounded up) vote in favour of executing, that player is "on the block".</p>
			<p>If less than half of the players vote in favour, the player escapes execution - and cannot be nominated again today.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The Storyteller will (usually) announce that nominations remain open and other players can nominate.</p>
			<p>Nominations will remain open for a short time to allow players to put someone else forward.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Bear in mind that each living player can only nominate once per day (and dead players cannot nominate).</p>
			<p>Also remember that votes can be added by dead players - they have 1 single ghost vote for the remainder of the game - use it wisely!</p>
			<p><em>If another player is nominated (with a player currently "on the block") the following happens:</em></p>
			<ul>
				<li>If they receive the same number of votes, the vote ties and neither player is executed tonight.</li>
				<li>If they receive the more votes, they become "on the block" and will be executed unless a further player is nominated.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Executing a player will end the Day phase immediately</b></p>
			<hr>
			<h3>Player Abilities</h3>
			<p>The wording of all player abilities is very specific in its meaning.</p>
			<p><b>If an ability reads "Each night*" then the * indicates "not on the first night" (which starts the game).</b></p>
			<p>If an ability reads "1 of 2 players" then you will learn 2 names.</p>
			<p>If an ability reads "a particular Minion" then you will a Minion Role.</p>
			<p>If an ability reads "alive" then any dead players do not count.</p>
			<p>If an ability reads "publicly" then must announce this when all players are present.</p>
			<p>If an ability reads "by execution" then Demon kills and other abilities do not trigger this.</p>
			<br>
			<p>You are encouraged to ask the Storyteller about your role and ability</p>
			<p>If you ask publicly, the Storyteller should give a "hypothetical" example if you were (not confirming or denying your role)</p>
			<p>If you ask privately, the Storyteller will not guide you, but might advise you of some considerations before making choices</p>
			<p>Bear in mind (depending on your play setup, e.g. in-person) you may not get the opportunity to ask during the first night, so think fast!</p>

			<h3>General Advice</h3>
			<h4>Three key tips for a new GOOD player:</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Read the script carefully</b> - the script will list all the possible roles 
						<br>
						and so give you all the information you need to work out who could be lying,
						<br>
						what information other people might be getting (and when), 
						<br>
						or what devious abilities are being used against you?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Give out your information carefully</b> - knowing who to trust will be difficult to start
						<br>
						but using cautious approaches like sharing your information with a select group could help
						<br>
						to work out who betrays you, or perhaps secretly who is giving out conflicting information?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>You can only win by killing</b> - the Demon obviously wants as much killing as possible
						<br>
						(other than themselves) because it reduces the amount of information the good team will get
						<br>
						There is a lot of useful information available by people offering to die 
						<br>
						(for example if they have all the information their role will get during this game)
						<br>
						or by activating other abilities through nomination and execution.
						<br>
						The good team cannot win if they do not execute!
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>And then three tips for a new EVIL player:</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Read the script carefully</b> - you will have to pretend to be another role
						<br>
						Try to prepare the information your "role" would get in case you want to divulge that to others 
						<br>
						You should also look out for roles that could be dangerous which should be eliminated first
						<br>
						Be particularly cautious of players who might have information that you are evil or regularly get information
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Speak to your team AS SOON AS POSSIBLE</b> - but be discreet
						<br>
						As the Demon, you will (usually) get bluffs and these could be handy for your Minions too!
						<br>
						Your minions might also have abilities which you could coordinate more effectively if discussed
						<br>
						However, bear in mind that grouping together as the Evil team looks very suspicious, so take care!
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Remember that good players lie</b> - this is often a key defense!
						<br>
						For various reasons, players might not want to reveal who they are, e.g.
						<br>
						It opens them up to the Demon attacking them that night
						<br>
						They might be a target for Minion abilities to stop them being useful
						<br>
						They want to be nominated/killed/executed at a specific time to get crucial information
						<br>
						Try to lay the groundwork with a few players you "trust" and sow a little discontent elsewhere!
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<hr>
			<h3>Poisoning and Drunkeness</h3>
			<p>Both poisoning and drunkeness have the same effect - your character role ability does not work</p>
			<p>However, the Storyteller will withhold this information during the game</p>
			<p>If your role gets information, you will receive information as normal... it will just be wrong</p>
			<p>If your role is supposed to have an effect... the effect just doesn't happen</p>
			<p>Use the information you gain to establish if you are poisoned or drunk</p>
			<p>Bear in mind there are few ways for players to be affected in Trouble Brewing anyway (Outsider:Drunk, Minion:Poisoner)</p>
			<p>This means that only one or two players are going to be receiving false information/failing to use effects each day</p>

			<h3>Gameflow</h3>
			<p>The game has two main phases - Night and Day - which alternate until the game end.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Night Phase</b> - this is when player night abilities activate, and the demon kills a player (not first night)</li>
				<li><b>Day Phase</b> - this is where players discuss who to nominate and vote to kill (once) and use day abilities</li>
			</ul>
			<em>Note that on night one, the Demon will usually NOT kill - this is just for setting up and early information gathering roles</em>
			<hr>
			<h3>Game End</h3>
			<p>The game ends when either:</p>
			<b>The Demon is killed - good wins</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>There are two living players and one of those is the Demon - evil wins</b>
			<p>Note that ending a day with 3 living players amounts to the same as the above - the Demon will kill a player that night and end the game</p>
			<br>
			<p>For that reason, the Storyteller may end the game immediately with an Evil team win if the Good team can no longer win</p>
			<p>There are several other rare conditions where a game might end early, but the Storyteller will usually wrap the game up early</p>
			<p>They will then offer the run down of which player had which actual roles/abilities and the key points from the game</p>
