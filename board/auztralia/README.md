==AuZtralia Setup Tool==
A web-based tool which allows for quick setup for the board game AuZtralia.

It's not that much setup, but I didn't like how long it took me to mentally process the placement rules.

This tool currently has the Eastern board, and all setup tiles from the base game.

You can click to view each setup tile individually, or automatically draw all the tiles.

The table will show the resources for each hex, and you can click in the table to highlight a hex.

This is now hosted on my Github pages at:
