/*
	DESCRIPTION

	These are the defined modal windows for Peep Defence

	IMPORTANT:

	any variables referenced (e.g. options.tower_cost) will be evaluated on init(),
	so by default these cannot provide any CURRENT or "live" values.

	Such modals should be handled separately, example below:

	USE THE <span id="modal-detail"></span> TRICK, a la 'Game Over' to
	show the modal and update the innerHTML of 'modal-detail' afterwards to achieve a "live" modal
