        <h3>Inns & Cathedrals Rules</h3>
        <h4>Tiles</h4>
        <p>The main tiles to note are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Inn Tiles</b> - these have a small building with a small chimney next to a pond</li>
          <li><b>Cathedral Tiles</b> - these are full city tiles with a large cathedral in the middle</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Meeples</h4>
        <p>This expansion adds a new meeple - <b>the large "Mega Meeple"</b> - which counts for double when determining a majority on any feature (road, city, field). It does NOT reward double points, it is only counted as two meeples when there are multiple meeples on a feature.</p>
        <p>This expansion also adds the pink 6th player set of meeples (8 meeples and an abbot).</p>
        <h4>Scoring</h4>
        <p>The scoring rules to note are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A road with an Inn on it is worth <b>double points if completed</b> and it is worth <b>no points if incomplete</b></li>
          <li>A city with a Cathedral in it is worth <b>double points if completed</b> and it is worth <b>no points if incomplete</b></li>

        <h3>Builders & Traders Rules</h3>
        <h4>Tiles</h4>
        <p>The main tiles to note are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Bridge Tiles</b> - these have two roads crossing over each other which <em>do not end</em>, they are continuous through the tile but do not join together</li>
          <li><b>Goods Tiles</b> - these have a symbol for one of three types of goods - wine, grain and cloth</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Meeples</h4>
        <p>This expansion adds two new meeples:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Builders</b> - these are tall meeples which can be placed on a road or city <b>where you already have a meeple placed</b>. If you extend this feature after placing the Builder on it, you can take a second (additional) turn straight away, placing a tile and meeple as usual. <b>You cannot cause a chain reaction - extending the feature with the Builder will not give you any further turns</b></li>
            <li><b>Pigs</b> - these are used in fields <b>where you have already placed a farmer</b>. If you have the majority (or tie for majority) in that field then you will score extra points (see scoring below)</li>
          </ul>
        <h4>Scoring</h4>
        <p>The scoring rules to note are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Goods tokens</b> - at the end of the game, the player with the most tokens of each type of goods will gain 10 victory points (tied players both get 10 points)</li>
          <li><b>Pig meeples </b> - at the end of the game, players with a pig meeple in a field (and a majority of meeples or tie for majority) will score 4 points for each completed city the field touches</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The School Rules</h3>
        <h4>Tiles</h4>
        <p>There are only two tiles in this mini-expansion:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>2 School tiles</b> - these are two tiles which must be placed side-by-side and form a school with 6 roads leading off it. If used <em>without the River expansion</em> then the School is placed beside the original start tile (continuing the road). Our house rule is to play this <em>with the River expansion</em> by placing the School tiles once <b>the first road on a tile <em>after</em> the River has been completed</b></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Meeples</h4>
        <p>This expansion adds a single meeple:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>The Teacher</b> - this meeple waits on the School <b>until a road leading to the School has been completed</b> and it then gets taken by that player (see scoring). Once all 6 roads leading to the School have been completed then the Teacher will remain at the School once used for scoring</li>
          </ul>
        <h4>Scoring</h4>
        <p>The scoring rule for the School is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If a player has the Teacher meeple, then the next time a feature is completed then the Teacher meeple grants the player who has it the same amount of points. If the player holding the meeple is the first to score a feature, they score double points for that feature. If multiple features are scored, only the first will give the holder of the Teacher meeple the same amount of points. Once used for scoring, the meeple returns to the School until the next road leading to the School is completed</li>
        </ul>
